# Handwritten 1-Digit Calculation Recognizer and Calculater

## Description
This project consists of a CNN model trained on a dataset of mathematical digit and operation symbols. Refer to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clarencezhao/handwritten-math-symbol-dataset for the dataset. 
Further, the model is then used to recignize any handwritten 1 digit calculations and proceeds to give output.
## Run the code

1. Clone the repository.
   
2. Navigate to the project directory containing the notebook and all resources.
   
3. Install the necessary packages:
   <br>(Python), Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow/keras, sklearn, cv2, PIL, os, pathlib.

5. Change path in code.
    <br>The given notebook was written on Kaggle, hence, the paths of the test images and the training data should be accordingly editted.
